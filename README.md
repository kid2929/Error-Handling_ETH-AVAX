# ExampleContract

## Overview
`ExampleContract` is a smart contract written in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. This contract provides functionalities such as setting and resetting a value, updating the owner, managing balances, and transferring funds between addresses. The contract also emits events to log significant actions.

## Features
- **Value Management**: Set, reset, and check the value with conditions.
- **Ownership Management**: Update and manage the contract owner.
- **Balance Management**: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer balances.
- **Event Emissions**: Emit events on significant actions to log changes.

## Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.26

## Contract Details

### State Variables
- `uint256 public value`: Stores a value.
- `address public owner`: Stores the address of the contract owner.
- `mapping(address => uint256) public balances`: Maps addresses to their balances.
- `uint256 public constant MAX_UINT`: The maximum value of a `uint256`.

### Events
- `event ValueChanged(uint256 newValue)`: Emitted when `value` is changed.
- `event OwnerChanged(address indexed oldOwner, address indexed newOwner)`: Emitted when the owner is changed.
- `event BalanceUpdated(address indexed user, uint256 newBalance)`: Emitted when a user's balance is updated.

### Constructor
- `constructor()`: Initializes the contract by setting the `msg.sender` as the owner and assigning an initial balance of 1000 to the owner.

### Functions

#### `setValue(uint256 _value)`
Sets the value with a requirement that it must be greater than zero.
```solidity
function setValue(uint256 _value) public
```
- Emits `ValueChanged`.

#### `updateOwner(address _newOwner)`
Updates the owner to a new address. Only the current owner can call this function.
```solidity
function updateOwner(address _newOwner) public
```
- Emits `OwnerChanged`.

#### `resetValue()`
Resets the value to zero. Only the owner can call this function.
```solidity
function resetValue() public
```
- Emits `ValueChanged`.

#### `transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount)`
Transfers a specified amount of balance from the caller to another address. Requires sufficient balance and a valid recipient address.
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) public
```
- Emits `BalanceUpdated` for both sender and recipient.

#### `deposit(uint256 _amount)`
Deposits a specified amount into the caller's balance. Requires the amount to be greater than zero.
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _amount) public
```
- Emits `BalanceUpdated`.

#### `withdraw(uint256 _amount)`
Withdraws a specified amount from the caller's balance. Requires sufficient balance.
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public
```
- Emits `BalanceUpdated`.

#### `checkInvariant()`
Checks the invariant that the owner's balance should not fall below 1000.
```solidity
function checkInvariant() public view
```

## Usage
1. Deploy the contract using a Solidity-compatible development environment.
2. Interact with the contract functions via a web3 interface or a Solidity development tool like Remix.

### Example
```javascript
const exampleContract = await ExampleContract.deployed();
await exampleContract.setValue(42);
await exampleContract.updateOwner(newOwnerAddress);
await exampleContract.deposit(500);
await exampleContract.transfer(recipientAddress, 200);
await exampleContract.withdraw(100);
const ownerBalance = await exampleContract.balances(ownerAddress);
```

## Testing
Ensure to test the contract thoroughly in a development environment. Consider edge cases and scenarios such as invalid inputs and unauthorized access attempts.

## Security Considerations
- Validate inputs rigorously to avoid unexpected behaviors.
- Ensure only the owner can perform sensitive operations like resetting value or updating the owner.
- Regularly audit the contract for vulnerabilities and update as necessary.
